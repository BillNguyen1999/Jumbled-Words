This document describes the requirements for Jumbled Words. The template for the Software
Requirements Specification (SRS) is a subset of the Volere
template ~\citep{RobertsonAndRobertson2012}. This document will highlight the stakeholders, functional and non-functional requirements, and the constraints presented in the completion of the product.

\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}

The purpose of this project is to improve on the desktop version of the product/game “Jumbled Words” in order to deliver a more complete version of the product. This more complete version of the product will include many new features such as new game modes such as a practice/learning mode where the user can decipher new words with an unlimited amount of guesses in order to decipher new words in a less competitive environment and also a new timer mode where there will be a timer for a set amount of time and the user has to decipher as many words as possible in the limited time. Other features include adding different difficulty levels where each difficulty will be based on the length of the word and a limited number of guesses, adding a leaderboard in order to develop a more competitive aspect to the game and improving the limited amount words that are already in the product by integrating a word library in order to store more words that will be useful to make this product more educational and enjoyable. The code of the product will also be very maintainable, modular, well documented and tested, which will allow any potential future developers to modify, reuse and understand the code.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}

No open issues have been identified.

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}

Since the product is a recreation/improvement of an existing Jumbled Words game, a basic product already exists. However, the base product offers limited features and functionalities and misses the ‘game’ aspect of the product. The basic functionality of guessing jumbled words is there but it is still quite far from a functional product that can be distributed to users and has brought in enough audience to have to maintain and support the software.\\
\\
The original jumbled words game can be found here: \href{https://code-projects.org/jumbled-words-quiz-in-python-with-source-code/}{Link}

\subsection{New Problems}

As for technical problems, a brand new backend to integrate all the new features together arises. From unit level to system-level testing needs to be implemented from the ground up for existing code, as well as new ones. As for the entertainment aspect, the product is projected for a wide range of audiences, from children to adults. The product must be easy enough for children to start playing and enjoying the game but also challenging and fun for the adults to continue playing and come back to. 

\subsection{Tasks}

All tasks that need to be accomplished are covered in the Gantt Charts provided in the project planning, which includes the allocation of time for specific tasks as well as the deadlines.\\
\\
The Gantt charts can be found here: \href{https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/balacs1/se3xa3-project/-/tree/master/ProjectSchedule}{Link}

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}

Due to an overhaul of the backend, many of the system-level code must be redone. However individual components will be carried over. These individual components will have dedicated testing as none was provided initially, with maintainability in mind, automated and regression testing will also be utilized. An executable version will also be available to be downloaded, unlike the current product that is executed through the command line.

\subsection{Risks}

Testing is a risk that must be assessed. Because the base product has no testing involved, testing functions must be developed from the ground up. This also means that any necessary changes required for the original code after testing must be done on top of the new features that the team will be working on. If the base code has significant issues, the limited time for the development of the new product will be of concern to plan ahead.

\subsection{Costs}

There is no cost involved in the development of this product as the budget is \$0.

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}

The product will be developed with ease of learning and usability in mind as mentioned in the requirements above. Hence separate user documentation nor training will be necessary. Although a sample playthrough will be provided as guidance and an introduction to the application.

\subsection{Waiting Room}

There are no additional requirements for future releases yet.

\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The development will leverage tools and technologies already used in the base product, like Python, and Tkinter for the front end.	
	\item The local database should be implemented as a local JSON file system, which includes the user data, high scores and the word library. 
\end{enumerate}
